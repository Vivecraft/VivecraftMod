# Vivecraft Mod (of Vivecraft fabric)
A port of [Vivecraft](https://www.vivecraft.org) to Fabric/Quilt and back to Forge.\
This is an official continuation of the project, using mixin's instead of patches.\
This means we could use a multiloader setup to develop on Fabric, Forge and Quilt at the same time.\
It also removed Optifine as a dependency, so mod compatibility *should* be better as well.

Since this version no longer has Optifine, we recommend you use Sodium (and the rest of the family) on Fabric/Quilt (and the unofficial ports on Forge) to maximize performance. For shaders you can use Iris on Fabric/Quilt (and the unofficial ports on Forge).

## Mod compatibility
Mod compatibility is important to us. If you find any issues, don't be afraid to open an issue. Be sure to check if it isn't already known though, so we don't have duplicates.
