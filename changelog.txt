		Prevent call to Item#initializeClient when in datagen (#8097)
		
		When running under data-generation, the Minecraft singleton is unavailable
		even though the operating env is under the CLIENT dist. Adding this check
		prevents crashes from devs unaware of this, as most uses of
		IItemRenderProperties (usually for a custom BEWLR) make use of the
		Minecraft singleton and therefore will cause NPEs if not guarded against.
		
		A similar thing happens in MobEffect and Block.

		Fix inverted hooks for PermissionsChangedEvent (#8089)
		
		Because IEventBus#post returns true on cancellation and the patched-in
		hooks inverts the return of the ForgeHooks method, if the player
		whose permission level is being changed is online and the event is not
		cancelled, the permission change _is_ cancelled.
		
		The fix is inverting the patched-in hooks and the default return value
		of the ForgeHooks method, so that the permission change is cancelled
		only if the player is online, the event is fired, and the event is cancelled.
		
		Fixes #8088

		where `'` is used frequently, like Canadian French from the bug report.

		- Added TierSortingRegistry, which can be used to add custom tiers and supports sorting between vanilla or with other mods.
		
		How to use:
		
		For the breaking system there's 2 methods:
		- getDestroySpeed decides if an item *can* mine the block fast. Override if you have multiple tags or your item isn't a DiggerItem.
		- isCorrectToolForDrops decides if an item will get drops. Returning false will also slow down mining, regardless of getDestroySpeed. Override if you have type-dependant tiers or your item isn't a DiggerItem.
		
		For the tier system mods can just call `TierSortingRegistry.registerTier(tier, "name", List.of(lesser tiers), List.of(better tiers));` to register their tiers.
		There's helper methods to query tiers such as TierSortingRegsitry.isCorrectTierForDrops.
		
		The ToolActions solve 2 problems:
		1. distinguishing which kind of digger an item can be
		2. querying if the item can perform specific secondary actions.
		Any item can override `canPerformAction` to customize which actions it performs.

		Expose RenderStateShard inner classes (#7895)
		
		In 1.17, all of the inner classes of `RenderStateShard` (`RenderStateShard.OverlayStateShard`, `RenderStateShard.WriteMaskStateShard`, etc.) have been changed to protected. These classes are needed however to create new `RenderType.CompositeRenderType`'s using `RenderType.CompositeState.CompositeStateBuilder`.
		Since these are protected inner classes, their constructors also can't be directly be obtained using `ObfuscationReflectionHelper`.
		
		Currently, any mod using custom `RenderType`'s will have to either:
		- add their own access transformer for the inner classes, or
		- extend `RenderStateShard` to access `RenderStateShard`'s inner classes, and extend `RenderType` to access `RenderType.CompositeRenderType`
		
		This PR changes the visibility of `RenderStateShard`'s inner classes to public in Forge's `accesstransformer.cfg`.
